# Kirbyxhibit

This Kirby theme is a quick and dirty attempt to render Kirby as kind of an Indexhibit based website.

## Kirby

Kirby is a file-based CMS created by Bastian Allgeier. “Easy to setup. Easy to use. Flexible as hell.”

## Indexhibit

Indexhibit is a CMS web application created by Daniel Eatock and Jeffery Vaska which is used to create archetypal, invisible websites in the established index + exhibit format.

## Setup

Only /assets/css/main.css and /site/snippets/ are different from a standard Kirby installation.
